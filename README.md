# cesium-demo

A small demo of Satellogic tools that allow us to use Cesium with Jupyter Notebooks.

You can see the results [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fisadev/cesium-demo/blob/master/cesium-demo.ipynb). Or you can download and run the notebook locally, it will install all the required dependencies :)
